Hi, my name is Michael Iniquez. I am sociology major minoring in Digital Humanities. This course seems really intriguing as it is much more suited for a humanities based major. As a sociology major, I am required to explore trends in society quantitatively and qualitatively. 
This class encompasses the quantitative aspect of a humanities based subject but in a way to further explore the matter at hand. This class is going to mainly use Python to explore data sets of our choosing. I am interested in working with census data or criminal data. To be broad, I am interested in uncovering social injustice to further suppurt underrepresented communities. 
My object for the class is to become better at cleaning data and overall working with data in a coding setting. I hope to learn python proficiently to uncover statistical findings and possibly create visualizations.
